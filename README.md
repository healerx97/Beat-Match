# Flatiron Phase 4 Project - BeatMatch

## Description

This project is scaffolded so that you can build a React frontend and Rails
backend together, and easily deploy them to Heroku.

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.7.4
- NodeJS (v14 or higher), and npm
- Postgresql

## Setup

**Fork and clone this repository**.

Then run:

```sh
bundle install
rails db:create
npm install --prefix client
```

You can use the following commands to run the application:

- `rails s`: run the backend on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `npm start --prefix client`: run the frontend on
  [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
- `rails start`: run the frontend and backend together with one command


## Acknowledgements

The frontend for this application was built using React, React Bootstrap, and ReactPlayer. The rails backend was configured using ActiveRecord, ActiveRecordSerializers, PostgreSQL, and BCrypt.
